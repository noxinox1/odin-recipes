    <h4>How to make Panna Cotta:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Off the heat, place 1 cup milk in a medium saucepan and sprinkle the top with 1 <br>
            packet gelatin. Let stand 3-5 min or until gelatin is softened. Place pan over <br>
            medium/low heat and stir until gelatin dissolves and mixture is steaming, about 4-5 min.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt. <br>
            Continue stirring for about 5 min until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture <br>
            is steaming. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place sour cream in a medium bowl with a pouring lip. Whisking constantly, gradually <br>
            add warm cream. Once the mixture is completely smooth, strain through a fine mesh sieve <br>
            if desired, then quickly divide it into 6 glass cups or 8 ramekins. Refrigerate until fully set; <br>
            4 to 6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How to make Berry Sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup berries, 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice, and 1/4 cup sugar. <br>
            Bring to a low boil and cook for 4-5 min or until syrupy.</li>
        <li>Stir in remaining 1 cup of fresh berries and remove from heat. When the <br>
            syrup is at room temp or just barely warm, spoon it over the top of chilled panna cottas.</li>
    </ol>
