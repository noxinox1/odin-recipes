        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I think of margherita pizza as the heartier cousin of Caprese salad, with a crisp, chewy crust supporting the delicious trio of tomatoes, <br>
                basil, and fresh mozzarella. Youâ€™ll find this classic pizza on the menu of any Neapolitan pizza joint, but you can also make a really great<br>
                homemade version. This margherita pizza recipe is here to prove it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                <li>2 small garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>Cornmeal, for stretching the dough</li>
                <li>1 pound Pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>Red pepper flakes, for sprinkling</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>In a food processor, place the tomatoes and their juices,<br>
                olive oil, garlic, and salt. Process until smooth.</li>
                <li>Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Place the pizza <br>
                    dough on the baking sheet and stretch it into a large <br>
                    oval.</li>
                <li>Spread a heaping 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce evenly <br>
                    over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the <br>
                    edges.</li>
                <li>Top with the mozarella and transfer to the hot oven. <br>
                    Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is browned.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil and <br>
                    pinches of red pepper flakes. Drizzle with olive oil and <br>
                    serve.</li>
            </ol>
