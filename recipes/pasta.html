        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>If you’ve never had homemade pasta carbonara before, you’re in for a real treat! <br>
            Pasta carbonara typically features a creamy sauce that’s made with pancetta, garlic, pasta water, cheese and eggs. <br>
            The egg-based sauce is cooked by combining it with the piping hot spaghetti pasta and a little of the cooking water.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>8 1/2 cups water, divides</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minces</li>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti or linguine</li>

            <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a <br>
                simmer over medium-high heat.</li>

            <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into a strainer while reserving <br>
                about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, <br>

            <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven. Add spaghetti and salt to boiling <br>
                water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.</li>
            <li> Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. <br>

            <li>Let pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2-4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. <br>
                Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional parmesan and parsley.</li>
